        <h2>This website</h2>
        <p>This is a work in progress (obviously), it will most likely continue
          to be updated throught my time in university, this site contains all of my projects.
          it feels as thought this paragraph is a paradox.</p>

        <h2>The Winux Web Design Framework</h2>
        <p>
          This is a porject that aims to standardise the way that the modern web works.
          it uses the philosophy that adding a shadow to different elements you can draw emphesis
          to those elements. there is no documentation for this as yet but there will
          be when the project is out of alpha.
          <br>
          This is a project that is in the alpha state, as a reult there is no download yet,
          but you can view the github repo <a href="https://github.com/Winux503/The-Winux-Web-Design-Framework">here.</a>
        </p>

        <h2>Expandable JavaScript Image Gallery</h2>
        <p>This is a prt of the Winux Web Design Framework and shows how all JS
          elements should be easily expandable and thould be easy enough for almost
          anyone to understand. It is licenced under the GNU Public Licence version 3.0.
          <br>The link to the github repo can be found <a href="https://github.com/Winux503/Expandable-Image-Gallery---JS">here.</a>

        <h2>YAUR - Yet Another Ubuntu Re-spin</h2>
        <p>This is a programming based Re-Spin of the Ubuntu Linux Operating System.
          This includes a large amount of programming related packages with a lightweight
          minimal interface to allow for clutter free programming on the Linux platform.<br>
          I do not yet have a github repo for this project.
        </p>

        <h2>Dual System Dedication - Less a Project, More a Theory.</h2>
        <p>This is less of a project and more of a theory. it would take an insane
          amount of space to explain it on this page, so I made a seperate page for it.<br>
          The basic jist is that using KVM on the Linux platform and removing its
          linitations you can run two operating systems along side eachother on the
          same hardware. Check the dedicated page for more information.
