        <h1>Experience</h1>
        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>I am moderatly prficitant at JavaScript, I know enough that I am able
          to make an Image Gallery. I still have alot to learn.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>C++</h3>
        <p>
          I have only just started learning this language, I hope to become more
          proficent at it as time goes on.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Operating Systems</h2>
        <h3>Windows</h3>
        <p>I have been using Windows consistantly my entire life and I am able
          solve most of its problems at this point, I have installed almost every
          version of Windows ever created and I still keep it dual booted on my
          PC to this day.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Linux</h3>
        <p>I have bee using Linux consistantly for the past 4 years. Recently I
          switched to Linux full time, I know how to use most Linux distributions
          and I have set up Linux servers in the past. Ubuntu remains my favourite
          distribution.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Malware</h2>
        <h3>Viruses, Viruses everywhere...</h3>
        <p>Now this is the big one, I have had many an experience with pretty much
          all the forms of malware out there whether accedently or on purpose. I
          know the ina and out of some of the most dealy peices of malware ever to be
          made. I use Virtual Machines to test various samples. I also look up Symantec,
          F-Secure and kaspersky logs to learn more about how viruses work. This is by far
          my strongest area in computing and I look forward to expanding my knowledge.
